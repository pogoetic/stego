The first indicator is the unemployment gap, which is the difference between the unemployment rate and the natural rate of unemployment (formerly called NAIRU, for the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment). 
A strong labor market prompts the Fed to tighten because an unemployment rate well below the natural rate is unsustainable by definition, and can lead to a spike in wage and price inflation. 
Looking at the current cycle, the labor market is in the early stages of overheating. We see unemployment heading to 3.5 percent, which would be consistent with the pre-recession behavior of the unemployment gap in past cycles.

One of the most reliable and consistent predictors of recession has been the Treasury yield curve. Recessions are always preceded by a flat or inverted yield curve, usually occurring about 12 months before the downturn begins. 
This occurs with T-bill yields rising as Fed policy becomes restrictive while 10-year yields rise at a slower pace. Looking at the current cycle, we expect that steady increases in the fed funds rate will continue to flatten the yield curve over the next 12–18 months.

Other indicators of the real economy, including aggregate weekly hours, decline in the months preceding a recession as employers begin to reduce headcount and cut the length of the workweek. 
Looking at the current cycle, aggregate weekly hours growth has been steady, albeit at weaker than average levels, reflecting slower labor force growth as baby boomers retire. 
We expect growth in hours worked to hold up over the coming year before slowing more markedly in 2019.

Real retail sales growth weakens significantly before a recession begins, with the inflection point typically occurring about 12 months before the start of the recession. 
Consumers cut back on spending as they start to feel the impact of slowing real income growth. This shows up most noticeably in retail sales, which are made up of a higher share of discretionary purchases than other measures of consumption. 
Looking at the current cycle, real retail sales growth has been steady at around 2 percent. This is weaker than the historical average, but is consistent with slower-trend gross domestic product (GDP) growth in this cycle.

Subtracting the natural rate of interest—which is the neutral fed funds rate, neither contractionary nor stimulative for the economy—from the real fed funds rate gives us a gauge of how loose or tight Fed policy is. 
Leading up to past recessions, the Fed has usually hiked rates beyond the natural rate to cool the labor market and get ahead of inflation, only to inadvertently push the economy into recession. 
Looking at the current cycle, we expect quarterly rate hikes to resume in December. This will put Fed policy well into restrictive territory next year, barring a sharper increase in the natural rate than we expect.
*Natural rate is Laubach-Williams one-sided filtered estimate.
Real Fed Funds Rate – Natural Rate of Interest (r*)

https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/files/el2017-16.pdf
Starting with a view of longer-run trends, Figure 1 plots the inflation-adjusted or “real” federal funds rate,
computed as the nominal federal funds rate minus the trailing four-quarter core personal consumption
expenditures (PCE) inflation rate. Core inflation tends to be a better predictor of future inflation because it
removes the volatile food and energy components.

"""NOTES:

Paul Comments: 
There is some work on this already (check Philly Fed and St louis Fed working papers).  I looked at these recently, highlighted the most important in red. I personally feel it is in the following order:
1.  10-2 yr spread (60%)
2.  S&P500 vs recent(last 12 or 24mo) peak/high (20%)    
3.  Change in Housing permits (10%)
4.  Change in Manufacturing Orders (5%)
5.  Consumer Sentiment (5%)

•   Manufacturing survey….leading indicator. Given lead times to build, this is historically a leading indicator. It was more pronounce when we were more of a manufacturing based society with less global influence but still predictive.
•   Housing Permits….. leading indicator given lead time to build. Also note interest rate increases slow consumer demand and construction companies know this. Somewhat correlated to yield curve.
•   Consumer sentiment….(mich survey) …leading indicator however I feel the S&P500 is a reliable gauge for this and more real time. The two series are highly correlated.

JPMorgan's proprietary model considers the levels of several economic indicators, including consumer sentiment, manufacturing sentiment, building permits, auto sales, and unemployment.
JPMorgan notes that nonfarm payrolls is actually not part of the model. But the unemployment rate is. Interestingly, a low unemployment rate can be considered an ominous sign.

“The unemployment rate enters the model in two ways," Edgerton explained. "As a near-term indicator, we watch for increases in the unemployment rate that occur near the beginning of recessions. So this morning's move down in the unemployment rate lowered the recession probability in our near-term model. But we also find the level of the unemployment rate to be one of the most useful indicators of medium-term recession risk. So the move down in unemployment raises the model's view of the risk of economic overheating in the medium run and raises the 'background risk' of recession."

Indeed, recessions begin when things are very good. It's only when reports come in that the data has turned that we realize we've been in a recession.

Paul O. - What to do just before recession: 
Between now and 12 mos from now, bond prices will have pressure so interest rate hedge ETF could better navigate this. Then swap them out 13mos (bypass short term cap gains tax) from now for non hedge versions so you can gain from price increases associate with rate decreases.  Just need to watch out for credit risk in order:
1.  Junk
2.  Investment grade Corp
3.  Muni

Paul O. - Economist from Moody's last week said the earliest predictor of a recession is when UE falls below the natural rate of unemployment. This lead is 3yrs, it happened June-2017.

#Leading Economic Index (LEI)
The Conference Board Leading Economic Index (LEI), which measures 10 key variables, is itself a recession predictor, albeit a fallible one. 
It has been irreverently said that the LEI predicted 15 out of the last eight recessions. 
Nevertheless, growth in the LEI always slows on a year-over-year basis heading into a recession, and turns negative about seven months out, on average. 
Looking at the current cycle, LEI growth of 4 percent over the past year has been on par with past cycles two years before a recession, and we will be watching for a deceleration over the course of the coming year.
